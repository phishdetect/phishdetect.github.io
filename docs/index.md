# PhishDetect Documentation

PhishDetect is a suite of libraries and tools to assist with the reporting, detection and prevention of phishing and other forms of digital attacks. It was created by [Claudio Guarnieri](https://nex.sx) and supported by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org) and [Security Without Borders](https://www.securitywithoutborders.org). PhishDetect was conceived to fill gaps in civil society's cyber security ecosystem, and aiding the efforts of non-profits supporting human rights defenders and journalists, but it is not limited to this single use case.

This documentation is intended for those seeking to set up and manage a PhishDetect instance or to programmatically interact with one. **This is not an end-user guide!** If you are looking for instructions on how to use PhishDetect, please [refer to the official website](https://phishdetect.io).
